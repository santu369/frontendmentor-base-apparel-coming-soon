  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

Worked on the mobile view first. Used CSS Grid for the Layout. After completing the layout, added a breakpoint and completed the Desktop design. Used a little Javascript for handling email validation and for showing error/success messages. Ran W3C HTML validator once completed and made minor changes for markup.
Used Perfect Pixel Google Chrome Extension for developing the component with pixel perfect accuracy.
Float can also be used but I thought of experimenting with CSS Grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS for email format validation
- BEM Methodology
- SASS

### What I learned

Used Grid for the layout. Grid is better for layouts where the position of the sections is not in the same sequence for different viewports. In this design, the image is to the right side on Larger Screens but on the mobile viewport, the image comes after the logo.

### Continued development

Would work further and complete Newbie challenges from the [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
